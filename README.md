# Nginx-Proxy Container for Dockerized Microservices

This repository provides a setup guide for creating a dedicated **nginx-proxy** container to efficiently manage and connect multiple Dockerized microservices. By using a single nginx-proxy instance, you can optimize server resources and simplify the management of your Docker architecture.

## Why Use an Nginx-Proxy Container?

When managing microservices in Docker, creating separate Nginx containers for each service can quickly consume server resources and complicate the setup. A single nginx-proxy container solves this issue by acting as a reverse proxy, routing traffic to the appropriate containers while maintaining a lightweight and efficient configuration.
